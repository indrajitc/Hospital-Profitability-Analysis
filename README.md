# Hospital-Profitability-Analysis
Given Orthopedic Equipment Sales and demographic data for a large list of US hospitals, I used SAS to perform Cluster Analysis and Factor Analysis to create clusters for high profit hospitals (on a testing dataset which only includes hospitals with positive sales numbers). Using the clustering algorithm given, I assign clusters to hospitals with low or nonexistent sales numbers to find a subset of hospitals that provide the greatest opportunity for sales potential (in the context of a hypothetical company that supplies Orthopedic Equipment to US Hospitals).  
## Description of Files
* hospital.xlsx: This is the xlsx file containing the Orthopedic Equipment sales and demographic variables for each of the hospitals given. 
* hosp-profit-analysis.sas: This is the SAS file where I perform the clustering and factor analysis on the list of hospitals to eventually find the subset of hospitals with maximum profit potential. 
* transformation_checking.sas: This is the SAS file where I check each covariate for violations of regression assumptions and perform appropriate transformation for those that violate one or more assumptions. 
* Hospital-Profitability Analysis.pdf: This pdf file contains a description of the project, it's goals, the datasets, the analysis and its corresponding figures.
